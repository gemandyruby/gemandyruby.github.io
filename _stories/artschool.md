Ruby adjusted her sketchpad, her fingers fidgeting nervously in the back corner of the art classroom. Life drawing wasn’t her strong suit, but she needed the practice. Around her, students chatted and settled into their spots, arranging charcoal, pencils, and erasers in preparation for the session. 

She glanced toward the front, curious about who the model would be today. 

“Alright, everyone,” the instructor called out, clapping his hands for attention. “Our model will be here shortly.” 

As if on cue, the door swung open. 

Ruby’s stomach dropped. Walking in, with the effortless poise of someone who always turned heads, was her sister, Gem. 

Of course. Ruby groaned internally. Of course it’s her. 

Gem made her entrance like she owned the place—which, knowing Gem, she might as well have. Her robe hung loosely at the waist, hinting at the statuesque figure beneath. Her impossibly tall, toned frame seemed to radiate confidence, every step deliberate and sure. 

“Good morning!” Gem greeted the instructor with her signature megawatt smile, her golden hair catching the soft overhead light as if it had been placed there specifically for her. Her voice carried effortlessly, the kind that made people pause and take notice. 

Around the room, students whispered to each other, eyes wide and curious. Some exchanged impressed glances. Ruby sank lower into her chair, gripping her sketchpad as though it could shield her from what was sure to be an afternoon of discomfort. 

Gem’s grin widened as she spotted Ruby. “Hey, Rubes! Didn’t know you were taking this class. Small world, huh?” She dropped her bag at the front of the room and climbed onto the platform in the center. Ruby groaned inwardly. She’d spent years trying to avoid the gravitational pull of her sister’s perfection, and now she was supposed to *study* it?  

The instructor clapped his hands. “Gem, whenever you’re ready.”  

“Alright, let’s get this party started,” Gem said. With an almost theatrical flair and a sashay of her hips, Gem untied the robe and let it slide from her shoulders.  

The room seemed to collectively hold its breath.  

Gem stood before the class completely naked. Her body was a masterpiece. Her six-foot frame was both powerful and graceful, with long, toned legs that seemed to go on forever. Her shoulders were broad yet elegant, her arms defined with sleek muscle. Her torso was the real showstopper—her abs rippled with definition, each line carved with precision, her waist tapering into perfect symmetry. Her tanned skin was smooth and radiant, glowing with health. Her ass, rounded and firm, completed the picture of perfection, sculpted as though by the hand of a master artist. And her breasts, full, perfectly proportioned, standing proud on her chest, added an effortless femininity to her otherwise athletic build.

Ruby’s face burned as she forced herself to look. She’d grown up around this. She’d *known* this was what her sister looked like. But to sit here, pencil in hand, and have to analyze every perfect curve, every shadow and highlight… it was torture.  

Gem, of course, was having the time of her life. She struck a simple standing pose at first, hands on her hips, her expression playful. “Okay, like, hope y’all are ready,” she said with a grin, her voice dripping with confidence. “This isn’t your basic-ass figure study or whatever.” 

The students chuckled nervously, and Gem basked in their attention.  

Ruby tried to focus, her pencil trembling as she sketched the long line of Gem’s legs. She glanced up at the platform, only to find Gem making direct eye contact with her.  

“Having fun over there, Rubes?” Gem teased, her voice light but carrying just enough edge to make Ruby bristle.  

“Just… drawing,” Ruby muttered, keeping her gaze firmly on her paper.  

Gem laughed softly, shifting into her next pose—a seated one, her legs crossed gracefully, one arm resting lightly on her knee. The pose was deceptively simple, but it highlighted the strength in her thighs and the definition in her abs. Ruby’s pencil slipped, creating a jagged line she had to erase quickly.  

For Ruby, every pose felt like a test, a reminder of all the ways she could never measure up. Gem was radiant, confident, and utterly untouchable. Ruby’s hands shook as she tried to capture the softness of Gem’s smile, the sharpness of her cheekbones, and the impossible symmetry of her face.  

The worst part was how clearly Gem was enjoying herself. She shifted into another pose, lying on her side with one arm propping up her head.  

“Don’t, like, be shy or whatever,” Gem said, flashing the room another dazzling smile. “You can stare. I’m used to it. It’s fine. I don’t bite. Well, not during class.”

A few students laughed nervously, and Ruby grit her teeth.  

When the timer buzzed, signaling the start of the break, Gem stretched dramatically on the platform, her robe draped casually over the chair behind her. She hopped down with an effortless grace, completely unbothered by her lack of coverage, and began sauntering naked around the room.

Her radiant smile, framed by her full lips and flawless skin, practically lit up the room as she casually unwrapped a candy bar. She took a slow, deliberate bite, her perfect teeth catching the attention of anyone not already mesmerized by the lines of her sculpted physique.

The eyes of the students followed her as she moved, her toned physique on full display. Her shoulders, back, and abs gleamed faintly in the soft studio light, every line of definition a testament to her genetics. Her walk was unhurried, a languid sway that made her hips move in a rhythm as captivating as it was effortless, each step exuding a confidence that turned heads without trying.

She stopped by the nearest student’s easel and leaned in to inspect their work, gesturing with the half-eaten candy bar. “Not bad. But see this part here? My arm’s actually a little thicker—gotta show the deltoids better. Here, look.” She flexed subtly, and the student’s eyes widened as they scrambled to adjust their sketch. “There, that’s more like it. You’re welcome.”

Moving on, Gem paused at another student’s station. “Ooh, love the shading. But you’re missing the curve here,” she said, tracing a line on her own hip. “It’s all about the angles, sweetie.” She struck a slight pose, emphasizing the curve she was talking about, before laughing at the stunned expression on the student’s face.

Finally, Gem made her way to Ruby, who had been sitting quietly, trying to focus on her drawing. When Ruby glanced up, her breath caught for a moment, just as it always did. No matter how many years she’d spent around Gem, her sister’s sheer presence never failed to stun her. The way Gem’s skin seemed to glow, her golden hair catching the light just so, and that infuriatingly perfect smile—it was impossible not to stare.

Gem, of course, noticed immediately. “Still can’t get used to how good I look, huh?” she teased, taking a bite of her candy bar.

Ruby rolled her eyes, quickly looking back at her drawing. “Don’t flatter yourself. You’re supposed to wear the robe during breaks. It’s the rules,” Ruby muttered, still trying to steady her hand.

“Oh, come on, Rubes,” Gem said with a grin, her voice dripping with mock exasperation. “Don’t be such a prude. I don’t think anyone minds.” She gestured broadly toward the other students, many of whom were still stealing glances at her. Gem just laughed softly. “See? I’m practically doing them a favor.”

Ruby sighed heavily, her annoyance only half genuine. Gem’s confidence was maddening, but her charm made it hard to stay truly angry.  

“Anyway,” Gem said, leaning over Ruby’s shoulder to inspect the drawing, “let’s see how you’re doing.”  

As she moved closer, her breasts lightly grazed Ruby’s shoulder, sending a jolt of warmth down Ruby’s spine. Ruby stiffened slightly, her cheeks warming, but she quickly ducked her head, pretending to focus on the sketch in front of her.  

“It’s fine,” Ruby said, her voice a touch too sharp as she tried to mask her reaction. “Just go sit down or something.”  

Gem ignored her. “Oh my god, Rubes. What even is this? Like, these abs? They look so… basic. You can’t just, like, skip details like that.” She casually flexed her stomach, running her hand over her abs. “See? These could, like, legit cut glass. Feel ‘em if you want, babe.” Gem absentmindedly ran her hand down her own stomach, pausing to point at specific areas. “See here? The upper two rows—you made them too soft. And this part,” she traced her finger across the side of her obliques, “needs more curve. They’re sharper in real life.”

Ruby groaned, her pencil pausing mid-stroke. “Gem, do you have to be so... detailed?”

Gem smirked. “It’s not my fault you’re struggling to capture perfection.” Then, without warning, she grabbed Ruby’s hand and pressed it against her bare stomach. “Here, feel for yourself. See how solid they are?”

Ruby gasped softly, startled by the sheer firmness beneath her fingers. She’d expected them to be defined, of course—Gem’s abs were legendary—but touching them was a whole different experience. They felt like carved marble, unyielding and impossibly precise. Ruby's fingers lingered, almost involuntarily tracing the sharp ridges and smooth skin. Her breath hitched as the heat of Gem’s body seemed to seep into her palm. She then yanked her hand back, her cheeks flushing.

“See what I mean?” Gem said, leaning back with a teasing grin. “You’ll never get it right if you don’t pay attention to the details, Rubes.”

Ruby groaned, her voice unsteady. “Gem…”

“Anyway,” she said, twirling her hair. “My shoulders are, like, way broader than that. And my boobs? Babe, please. They’re perkier than this sad sketch you’ve got going on.” She cupped her large breasts to demonstrate.

Ruby tossed down her pencil in frustration.

Gem laughed, standing upright and taking another bite of her candy bar. “You’re cute when you’re mad.” She ruffled Ruby’s hair and leaned in to whisper, “You’re lucky to have me as a muse.” Her eyes sparkled mischievously, and her smile was as radiant as ever. Gem winked before sauntering back toward the platform, still munching on her candy bar.

As the session neared its end, the instructor asked for one final pose. Gem grinned, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “You want a good one to finish off?” she asked, her voice dripping with confidence.

Before waiting for an answer, she began with a warrior pose, her long legs extending in a perfect line, her arms reaching with graceful precision. Her muscles shifted under her skin with every movement, a living sculpture of strength and control.

Ruby’s pencil hovered above her sketchpad, her brows furrowed. “What is she doing now?”

The room was captivated as Gem transitioned into a dancer’s pose, her foot arcing upward as she held it behind her head, her balance flawless. The curve of her back, the stretch of her long legs—it was mesmerizing.

“She’s like a goddess,” one of the students whispered, breaking the quiet reverence in the room.

From there, Gem lowered herself into a low lunge twist, her torso rotating to one side, revealing her impossibly defined abs. She gave a casual glance in Ruby’s direction. “Don’t forget to catch the light on the obliques, Rubes. That’s where the magic happens.”

Ruby muttered something incoherent, her pencil scratching frantically across the paper.

Then, with barely a moment of hesitation, Gem planted her hands on the platform and kicked her legs into the air, transitioning into a two-arm handstand. The room collectively gasped. Her body was perfectly aligned, her toes pointing to the ceiling, her arms steady as marble columns.

Ruby blinked, her mouth slightly open. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” she whispered, her pencil momentarily still.

Gem lifted one hand off the ground, shifting into a one-arm handstand. The silence in the room was deafening as she balanced there, seemingly weightless, her entire body a perfect line of strength and grace.

Ruby’s pencil snapped in her grip. “How does she even—what the hell am I supposed to do with this?”

Gem laughed lightly, holding the pose for an impossibly long time. “Draw faster, Rubes. You’ll miss the details.” Her voice was effortlessly steady despite the strain.

After a few moments, she bent her free arm into a pose, showing off her biceps while still balanced on one hand. “See this? Functional art,” she joked.

When she finally came down from the handstand, she transitioned seamlessly into a seated pose, her breathing completely even. “Well?” she asked, glancing at Ruby. “That should’ve given you enough material to finish my masterpiece.”

Ruby set her pencil down, her face a mixture of frustration and awe. The other students burst into applause, and Gem took a mock bow from her seated position. “Thank you, thank you. Don’t all fight to draw me next week.”

Ruby groaned, burying her face in her hands. “I don’t know how I’m related to you.”

Gem just grinned. “Pure luck, babe. Pure luck.”

As the session wrapped up, the instructor clapped their hands, signaling the end of the class. “Great work, everyone! You’re free to go.”  

Gem stretched on the platform, her movements fluid and deliberate, like a cat. She hopped down gracefully and began wrapping herself in the robe—though she didn’t bother tying it, leaving it hanging loosely around her figure. As she strolled past Ruby’s easel, she paused and gave her sister a teasing grin.

“Okay, like, not bad, Rubes,” Gem said, tilting her head to study the drawing. “But, for real, you could’ve made me look a *little* more godlike. I mean, I don’t look this basic, right?”

Ruby sighed. “How about you draw yourself, then?”

Gem rolled her eyes dramatically. “Ugh, fine. Watch and learn, babe.” She ruffled Ruby’s hair with a wink. “Try not to get too jealous.”

She grabbed an empty sheet of paper and a few pencils from the instructor’s supply table. Without so much as sitting down, she placed the paper on a nearby easel and began sketching.

Her hand moved with unexpected precision, quick but deliberate, as if the image in her mind was guiding her every stroke. The other students, packing up their things, started to notice. One by one, they drifted over, their curiosity piqued.

Ruby crossed her arms, watching from her seat. “Oh, for fuck’s sake. What are you doing now?”

“Showing everyone how it’s done, duh,” Gem replied without looking up, a smirk curling her lips.

The sketch began to take shape—a portrait of herself. Gem captured the sharp lines of her jaw, the arch of her brows, and the soft fullness of her lips. The shading around her eyes gave them a lifelike sparkle, and her expression radiated the confident charisma she exuded in real life.

She added the contours of her shoulders and torso with a practiced hand, defining the subtle interplay of light and shadow on her muscles. She casually sketched the soft curves of her breasts, treating it as just another part of the whole. Her abs were drawn with a precision that made Ruby blink in surprise, each ridge and curve perfectly rendered.

“You’ve *got* to be shitting me,” Ruby muttered under her breath, inching closer despite herself.

As Gem was finishing, the students' expressions shifted from curiosity to disbelief. People who had been drawing for years, honing their craft with dedication and practice, watched as Gem, who hadn’t picked up a pencil in ages, casually outdid them all with an ease that felt almost insulting.  

One of the students tried to hide the envy flickering in their eyes, but their tightened jaw and forced smile betrayed them. Another shuffled awkwardly, gripping their own sketchbook as though it might shield them from Gem's brilliance.  

When Gem finally stepped back and tilted her head at her work, her lips curled into a sly smile. “Wow. Didn’t think I had it in me,” she said, as if she hadn’t just blown everyone away with a casual masterpiece.  

The instructor approached, wide-eyed and speechless, as Gem handed over the portrait with an exaggerated flourish. “You can keep it,” she said, her voice dripping with mock generosity. “Consider it a gift. You know, for the *art world* or whatever.”  

As the instructor stammered a thank you, clutching the portrait as if it were a priceless treasure, Gem’s gaze swept over the group of students. Their unspoken jealousy hung thick in the air, and it only seemed to amuse her further.  

Gem chuckled, leaning closer to Ruby and stage-whispering, “You can practically *feel* how mad they are. It’s, like, kinda adorable.” She gave a quick wink before sauntering back to the platform, leaving a wave of stunned silence and simmering envy in her wake.  

The students couldn’t help but steal glances, captivated by the sway of her hips and the effortless confidence in her stride. When she reached for her clothes, she slipped the robe off her shoulders with an unhurried motion, letting it slide to the platform in a silken heap.  

For a moment, the room seemed to hold its breath. Her beauty was almost otherworldly—her skin glowing, her muscles subtly flexing as she moved, the soft curve of her smile catching the light. It wasn’t just her looks, though; it was the way she carried herself, as if she was untouchable, invincible.  

Ruby, seated at her easel, couldn’t help but feel a familiar mix of admiration and irritation. Gem’s natural brilliance and poise were like a spotlight that never dimmed, and Ruby had spent her life trying to avoid its glare.  

Gem bent to grab her clothes, slipping on a pair of black underwear with casual ease, the motion as graceful as if she were performing on stage. She didn’t bother with a bra—she didn’t need one, and everyone who looked at her knew it. Instead, she pulled her crop top over her head, adjusting it so it framed her toned abs perfectly.  

She slipped into her fitted jeans, their snug lines accentuating her every move, and tied her hair into a loose ponytail with practiced ease. Glancing over at Ruby with a mischievous grin, she slung her bag over her shoulder.  

“Well, shit, that was fun,” she said, gesturing to herself with a playful flourish, her eyes sparkling. “I mean, how often do people get the chance to draw *this*?”  

Ruby rolled her eyes, but the faintest hint of a smile tugged at her lips despite herself.

“Come on, Rubes,” Gem continued, grabbing her bag and slinging it over her shoulder. “Admit it—you’re lucky to have me as your model. I mean, not everyone gets this kind of inspiration. You should be thanking me, really.”  

Ruby clenched her jaw but said nothing, focusing instead on packing up her pencils.  

“Seriously, though,” Gem went on, strolling casually beside her. “I’ve been thinking—I could probably do this art thing if I wanted to. I mean, it can’t be that hard, right? It’s just practice, right?”  

Ruby gritted her teeth. “Right.”  

“But,” Gem continued, her voice light, “then I remember—I’ve already got a PhD. In physics. At sixteen. And, you know, being a physicist is kind of a big deal. Changing the way people think about the universe? Yeah, that feels pretty important.”  

Ruby slammed her sketchpad into her bag a little harder than necessary.  

“Don’t get me wrong,” Gem added, oblivious or indifferent to Ruby’s growing tension, “art’s great. It’s just... I don’t know, it’s hard to compare when you’re literally changing the world with equations. Not that you need to worry about that.”

Ruby spun to face her, her cheeks flushed with anger. “What’s that supposed to mean?”  

Gem blinked, then shrugged with an innocent smile. “Nothing! Just, you know, you’ve got your thing, I’ve got mine. I’m just saying—it’s funny how you’re here busting your ass to learn something I can do better without even trying.”  

Ruby’s hands balled into fists at her sides. 

Gem tilted her head, her smile softening. “Hey, don’t get mad. I’m just being honest. You’re good, Rubes. You are. But come on, we both know I’m—”  

“Stop,” Ruby snapped, her voice shaking. “Just stop.”  

Without warning, Gem slipped an arm around Ruby’s waist, her movements quick and deliberate. “Oh, come on, Rubes,” she said, lifting Ruby off the ground with ease, her voice laced with teasing amusement. Ruby gasped, her hands flying to Gem’s shoulders, but her anger was now mixed with shock.  

Without missing a beat, Gem kissed her. It wasn’t slow or hesitant—just a quick, soft press of her lips to Ruby’s, friendly yet disarming in its confidence. Ruby froze, the heat of Gem’s body pressed firmly against hers making her head spin.  

All at once, Ruby forgot why she’d been angry in the first place. The solid strength of Gem’s arms holding her, the softness of her lips, and the faint scent of her hair left Ruby in a daze. Warmth spread through her, erasing every trace of her earlier frustration.  

Before Ruby could even process the kiss, Gem set her down with a teasing grin. Her hands lingered at Ruby’s waist for just a second longer than necessary before she stepped back.  

“There,” Gem said, her voice light and full of mischief. “See? Now you’ve officially been kissed by a goddess. You can thank me later.”  

Ruby’s cheeks burned as she stared at her sister, utterly at a loss for words. She could still feel the faint impression of Gem’s lips on hers, and her heart was pounding in a way that had nothing to do with being lifted off the ground.  

Gem grabbed her bag and slung it over her shoulder. “Come on, Rubes. Let’s go before you combust.”  

Ruby followed her out of the studio, her steps unsteady and her mind a blur. Whatever annoyance she’d felt before was long gone, replaced by the lingering sensation of Gem’s kiss and the maddening realization that Gem always, always knew how to steal the spotlight—and Ruby’s composure—without even trying.
