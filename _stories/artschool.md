title: Art School Antics

Ruby adjusted her sketchpad nervously, sitting in the back corner of the art classroom. Life drawing wasn’t her favorite, but she needed the practice. As students settled in, she glanced toward the front, curious about the model for today’s session.  

“Okay, everyone,” the instructor announced. “Let’s get started. Our model will be here shortly.”  

The door opened, and Ruby’s stomach dropped.  

Gem Stone, Ruby's younger sister, sauntered in, six feet of radiant confidence wrapped in a loosely tied robe. Heads turned instantly, conversations faltered, and someone audibly gasped. With her perfectly symmetrical face—sharp cheekbones, full lips, and mischievous blue eyes—Gem looked like she’d stepped out of a Renaissance painting. Her golden hair cascaded down her back in soft waves, glowing under the studio lights.  

Ruby slumped in her seat. “Oh, come on,” she muttered under her breath.  

Spotting her sister, Gem grinned and strode over. “Rubes! Didn’t know you’d be here. Lucky you, huh?”  

Ruby glared. “Lucky isn’t the word I’d use.”  

Gem ignored her and turned to the instructor. “So, where do you want me? I’m ready to give these people the show of their lives.”  

Gem untied her robe with a dramatic flourish, letting it fall to the floor. The room went utterly silent.  

She stood before the class completely naked. Her body was mesmerizing—a six-foot statue of flawless symmetry and sculpted perfection. Her abs, deeply carved and impossibly symmetrical, tapered down to a narrow waist. Her toned arms and long, muscular legs gave her an athletic yet feminine look, and her full breasts, firm and proud on her chest, perfectly complemented her statuesque frame. Even standing still, she radiated effortless grace.  

The first few poses were relatively simple, giving the class time to adjust to their model’s overwhelming presence. Ruby struggled, her pencil faltering as she tried to capture Gem’s symmetrical features. The arch of her brow, the curve of her lips—everything about her sister was maddeningly perfect.

When the timer buzzed, signaling the start of the break, Gem stretched dramatically on the platform, her robe draped casually over the chair behind her. She hopped down with an effortless grace, completely unbothered by her lack of coverage, and began sauntering naked around the room.

Her radiant smile, framed by her full lips and flawless skin, practically lit up the room as she casually unwrapped a candy bar. She took a slow, deliberate bite, her perfect teeth catching the attention of anyone not already mesmerized by the lines of her sculpted physique.

The eyes of the students followed her as she moved, her toned physique on full display. Her shoulders, back, and abs gleamed faintly in the soft studio light, every line of definition a testament to her genetics.

She stopped by the nearest student’s easel and leaned in to inspect their work, gesturing with the half-eaten candy bar. “Not bad. But see this part here? My arm’s actually a little thicker—gotta show the deltoids better. Here, look.” She flexed subtly, and the student’s eyes widened as they scrambled to adjust their sketch. “There, that’s more like it. You’re welcome.”

Moving on, Gem paused at another student’s station. “Ooh, love the shading. But you’re missing the curve here,” she said, tracing a line on her own hip. “It’s all about the angles, sweetie.” She struck a slight pose, emphasizing the curve she was talking about, before laughing at the stunned expression on the student’s face.

Finally, she made her way to Ruby, who had been sitting quietly, trying to focus on her drawing. Ruby glanced up and immediately frowned. “Gem, you’re supposed to wear the robe during breaks. It’s the rules.”

Gem grinned, taking another bite of her candy bar. “Rules? Babe, have you met me? Besides, I don't think anyone minds.” She leaned over Ruby’s shoulder, her hair brushing lightly against her sister’s arm. “Anyway, let’s see how you’re doing.”

Ruby sighed, her exasperation barely concealed. “It’s fine. Just go sit down or something.”

But Gem ignored her, studying the drawing intently. Ruby sighed, shaking her head as Gem leaned over her shoulder. Her sister’s closeness was impossible to ignore—the faint scent of her perfume, the glow of her skin, the way her body seemed to exude effortless confidence. After a moment, she pointed to the midsection. “Okay, Rubes, here’s your problem: You’re not doing my abs justice. They’re more defined. Like, seriously, they could cut glass.” She absentmindedly ran her hand down her own stomach, as if to emphasize her point.

Ruby groaned. “Gem…”

“And the curve of my ribs? A little more pronounced. Oh, and the angle of my shoulders—you made them too narrow. I’m broader than that.” Gem flexed her arms slightly, showcasing the width of her frame. “See? Also, my breasts aren't quite that small. I mean, come on, Rubes, you’ve seen them enough times.” She cupped her own large breasts to demonstrate.

Ruby tossed down her pencil in frustration. “You’re insufferable.”  

Gem laughed, standing upright and taking another bite of her candy bar. “You’re cute when you’re mad.” She ruffled Ruby’s hair and leaned in to whisper, “You’re lucky to have me as a muse.” Her eyes sparkled mischievously, and her smile was as radiant as ever.

Ruby glared at her but couldn’t hide the small smile tugging at her lips. “You’re impossible.”

“And yet, here I am,” Gem said with a wink, before sauntering back toward the platform, still munching on her candy bar.

As the session neared its end, the instructor asked for one final pose. Gem grinned, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “You want a good one to finish off?” she asked, her voice dripping with confidence.

Before waiting for an answer, she began with a warrior pose, her long legs extending in a perfect line, her arms reaching with graceful precision. Her muscles shifted under her skin with every movement, a living sculpture of strength and control.

Ruby’s pencil hovered above her sketchpad, her brows furrowed. “What is she doing now?”

The room was captivated as Gem transitioned into a dancer’s pose, her foot arcing upward as she held it behind her head, her balance flawless. The curve of her back, the stretch of her long legs—it was mesmerizing.

“She’s like a goddess,” one of the students whispered, breaking the quiet reverence in the room.

From there, Gem lowered herself into a low lunge twist, her torso rotating to one side, revealing her impossibly defined abs. She gave a casual glance in Ruby’s direction. “Don’t forget to catch the light on the obliques, Rubes. That’s where the magic happens.”

Ruby muttered something incoherent, her pencil scratching frantically across the paper.

Then, with barely a moment of hesitation, Gem planted her hands on the platform and kicked her legs into the air, transitioning into a two-arm handstand. The room collectively gasped. Her body was perfectly aligned, her toes pointing to the ceiling, her arms steady as marble columns.

Ruby blinked, her mouth slightly open. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” she whispered, her pencil momentarily still.

Gem lifted one hand off the ground, shifting into a one-arm handstand. The silence in the room was deafening as she balanced there, seemingly weightless, her entire body a perfect line of strength and grace.

Ruby’s pencil snapped in her grip. “How does she even—what the hell am I supposed to do with this?”

Gem laughed lightly, holding the pose for an impossibly long time. “Draw faster, Rubes. You’ll miss the details.” Her voice was effortlessly steady despite the strain.

After a few moments, she bent her free arm into a pose, showing off her biceps while still balanced on one hand. “See this? Functional art,” she joked.

When she finally came down from the handstand, she transitioned seamlessly into a seated pose, her breathing completely even. “Well?” she asked, glancing at Ruby. “That should’ve given you enough material to finish my masterpiece.”

Ruby set her pencil down, her face a mixture of frustration and awe. “You’re impossible.”

Gem smirked, brushing her hair over her shoulder. “And yet, here I am, making your life interesting. You’re welcome.”

The other students burst into applause, and Gem took a mock bow from her seated position. “Thank you, thank you. Don’t all fight to draw me next week.”

Ruby groaned, burying her face in her hands. “I don’t know how I’m related to you.”

Gem just grinned. “Pure luck, babe. Pure luck.”

As the session wrapped up, the instructor clapped their hands, signaling the end of the class. “Great work, everyone! You’re free to go.”  

Gem stretched on the platform, her movements fluid and deliberate, like a cat. She hopped down gracefully and began wrapping herself in the robe—though she didn’t bother tying it, leaving it hanging loosely around her figure. As she strolled past Ruby’s easel, she paused and gave her sister a teasing grin.  

“Not bad, Rubes,” Gem said, tilting her head to study the drawing. “But, you know, you could’ve made me look a little more godlike.”  

Ruby sighed. “How about you draw yourself, then?”

“Why not?” Gem ruffled Ruby’s hair and winked. “Watch and learn, little sis.”  

She grabbed an empty sheet of paper and a few pencils from the instructor’s supply table. Without so much as sitting down, she placed the paper on a nearby easel and began sketching.  

Her hand moved with unexpected precision, quick but deliberate, as if the image in her mind was guiding her every stroke. The other students, packing up their things, started to notice. One by one, they drifted over, their curiosity piqued.  

Ruby crossed her arms, watching from her seat. “Oh, come on. What are you doing now?”  

“Just showing everyone how it’s done,” Gem replied with a smirk, not looking up.  

The sketch began to take shape—a portrait of herself. Gem captured the sharp lines of her jaw, the arch of her brows, and the soft fullness of her lips. The shading around her eyes gave them a lifelike sparkle, and her expression radiated the confident charisma she exuded in real life.  

She added the contours of her shoulders and torso with a practiced hand, defining the subtle interplay of light and shadow on her muscles. Her abs were drawn with a precision that made Ruby blink in surprise, each ridge and curve perfectly rendered.  

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Ruby muttered under her breath, inching closer despite herself.  

Gem stepped back to inspect her work, chewing on the eraser of her pencil. “Huh. Not bad for someone who hasn’t touched a pencil in years.”  

One of the students, wide-eyed, leaned in to get a closer look. “That’s... that’s incredible.”  

Another nodded, whispering, “It looks like it should be in a museum.”  

Gem tossed her hair over her shoulder, a playful grin spreading across her face. “What can I say? Some of us are just born with it.” She shot a glance at Ruby, her eyes glinting with mischief. “No offense, Rubes.”  

Ruby rolled her eyes, though her cheeks were faintly pink. “You’re ridiculous.”  

Gem handed the sketch to the instructor, who stood speechless, holding the paper as though it were a priceless artifact. “You can keep it,” she said casually. “Call it a gift. Don’t all thank me at once.”  

The class broke into scattered applause, and Gem gave an exaggerated bow, the loose robe sliding off one shoulder as she laughed. “Alright, I think my work here is done.”  

Ruby shook her head, muttering under her breath. “Unbelievable.”  

Gem grinned and slung an arm around Ruby’s shoulders, steering her toward the exit. “Oh, c’mon. Admit it—you’re a little impressed.”  

“You’re impossible,” Ruby said flatly.  

Gem shrugged. “I mean, come on. You got to draw a literal goddess today. That’s a win.”
