The sleek convertible hummed down the road, the top down and the wind whipping through their hair. Gem was at the wheel, one hand casually draped over the steering wheel, the other perched on the edge of the door as if she were posing for a magazine cover. Her golden hair shimmered in the sunlight, and her aviator sunglasses added an extra layer of cool to her already overwhelming presence.  

Ruby sat in the passenger seat, arms crossed, bracing herself for another Gem-centric monologue.  

“I still can’t believe how easy that paper was to publish,” Gem said, her voice a mix of nonchalance and pride. “I mean, astrophysics journals don’t just take anything, but when your work rewrites theories, they practically beg for it.” She smirked, glancing at Ruby out of the corner of her eye. “Not that I blame them. I’d beg for me too.”  

Ruby groaned. “Do you ever stop?”  

“Why would I?” Gem laughed, her perfect white teeth flashing. “Oh, and did I tell you about the time I fixed the particle accelerator in Geneva? They were stumped for weeks, and then I walk in, look at the problem, and bam—solved in an hour. They’re probably still talking about me over there.”  

Ruby rolled her eyes. “I’m sure they are.”  

“And you know,” Gem continued, as if Ruby hadn’t spoken, “I’m thinking of taking up surfing more seriously. Remember last summer when I caught that wave everyone else wiped out on? That was epic. It’s like my balance is just… flawless.”  

Ruby didn’t reply, but her silence only fueled Gem’s enthusiasm.  

“Speaking of balance, I can hold a one-arm handstand for over five minutes now,” Gem said, tapping her fingers on the wheel. “I timed myself yesterday. I mean, it’s not like it’s hard, I only stopped because I was getting bored. But still, pretty impressive, right?”  

Ruby shot her a look. “If I say yes, will you stop?”  

Gem grinned, tilting her sunglasses down just enough to reveal her piercing blue eyes. “Not a chance. Oh! And wait until we get to the mall. I’ve been meaning to try on those ridiculously tight dresses at that new store. You can help me pick the one that makes me look the most like a goddess.”  

“You already act like one,” Ruby muttered under her breath, barely audible over the wind.  

Gem laughed again, the sound rich and melodious, as if Ruby’s remark was the highest compliment she could receive. “I know, right? Lucky you—you get to bask in my glory every day.”  

As they pulled into the mall parking lot, Gem parked the car with a fluid ease, flipping her sunglasses back into place. She leaned over to Ruby with a playful smirk. “Ready to have the best mall trip of your life?”  

Ruby sighed. “Let’s just get this over with.”  

Gem winked. “That’s the spirit.”  

---

The glass doors of the mall slid open, and Gem stepped in first, radiating an effortless confidence that seemed to shift the atmosphere around her. Heads turned as she passed—men, women, even a few kids who barely knew why they were staring. Her golden hair shimmered under the fluorescent lights, and her lean, athletic frame seemed to glide rather than walk. She was wearing a fitted crop top that showed off her chiseled abs and a pair of high-waisted jeans that hugged her long, toned legs perfectly.  

Ruby followed a step behind, half-rolling her eyes and half-trying to pretend she wasn’t with her sister. “Does this happen everywhere you go?” she muttered.  

Gem grinned, flashing a smile that could have sold toothpaste. “Of course it does. What can I say? Some of us are just unforgettable.”  

They strolled past a group of teenagers loitering by the entrance. One of the boys nudged his friend and pointed at Gem, whispering something that made them both burst out laughing nervously. Gem noticed but didn’t miss a beat. She turned her head just enough to wink at them, sending the group into a flurry of awkward chuckles and blushing.  

Ruby groaned. “Do you *have* to encourage them?”  

“Rubes, I can’t help it if I’m a goddess among mortals,” Gem said, shrugging playfully. “Besides, they should feel lucky. Not everyone gets to witness perfection in person.”  

As they walked further into the mall, a woman carrying shopping bags stopped mid-stride and did a double take. “Excuse me,” she said hesitantly, “are you a model? Or an actress? You look so familiar.”  

Gem tilted her head and smiled, resting a hand casually on her hip. “Nope, just naturally stunning. But I get that all the time.”  

The woman laughed awkwardly and walked away, still glancing back over her shoulder.  

Ruby sighed. “This is going to be a long day.”  

“Oh, come on, it’s fun,” Gem said, tossing her hair back as they passed a display window featuring mannequins in glittering evening gowns. She stopped abruptly, her reflection catching her eye. “Ooh, remind me to try something like that on later. I bet I’d look amazing.”  

“You’d probably cause a scene,” Ruby muttered.  

Gem smirked, throwing an arm around her sister’s shoulders. “You say that like it’s a bad thing.”  

As they walked past the food court, Gem’s eyes lit up. “Oh, we’re definitely hitting that pretzel place later. And maybe the frozen yogurt shop. And—oh! I think there’s a new bakery here, too.”  

Ruby raised an eyebrow. “You’re planning to eat *all* of that?”  

“Of course,” Gem said with a laugh. “I burn calories just by existing. It’s a gift, really.”  

Ruby shook her head. “You’re impossible.”  

Gem grinned down at her sister. “And you wouldn’t have it any other way.”  

---

Gem sauntered into the boutique like she owned the place, her golden hair gleaming under the soft, flattering lights. The upbeat music thumped gently in the background, and racks of carefully curated clothes lined the space.

“Oh my god, Ruby, this place is, like, *so* cute,” Gem said, running her fingers over a rack of sparkly dresses. “I could totally see myself killing it in one of these.”  

Ruby followed reluctantly, already anticipating the spectacle. “You don’t need to kill anything, Gem. The whole mall already noticed when we walked in.”  

Gem snorted, flipping her hair. “Well, duh. Can you blame them? Anyway, I’m *definitely* trying stuff on.” She picked up a skintight dress, a barely-there red bikini, and a nightgown with a plunging neckline and open front. “This is, like, exactly my vibe.”  

Ruby sighed. “Why do I feel like this is going to be a thing?”  

“It’s always a thing when I’m involved,” Gem replied, grinning. “Now sit tight, Rubes. You’re about to get a show.”  

A few minutes later, Gem stepped out of the fitting room wearing the red bikini. The top was barely enough to cover her full, rounded breasts, which seemed to defy gravity, and the bottoms sat low on her hips, perfectly framing her sculpted abs and toned thighs. She turned around, giving Ruby—and anyone else paying attention—a view of her firm, perfectly shaped butt.  

“What do you think?” Gem asked, striking a pose with her hands on her hips.  

“I think this mall has security cameras, and they’re probably zooming in right now,” Ruby muttered, trying to ignore the stares from nearby shoppers.  

Gem laughed, tossing her hair. “Let them. Like, seriously, if you’re gonna stare, at least *enjoy* it.” She turned to admire herself in the mirror. “God, my boobs look amazing in this. Like, holy shit, I’m perfect.”  

“Modest as ever,” Ruby said dryly.  

“Why would I be modest?” Gem replied, smirking. “If I had to look at me, I’d be obsessed too.”  

She disappeared into the fitting room and re-emerged in the black bikini. This one was even skimpier, with gold accents that highlighted her glowing skin. The top pushed her breasts up slightly, making them look even fuller, and the bottoms accentuated her hips and backside in a way that made Ruby groan.  

“Yep, buying this one,” Gem declared, turning to look over her shoulder. “My ass looks *so* good.”  

“You’re impossible,” Ruby muttered, burying her face in her hands.  

“Oh, please,” Gem said with a laugh. “You love me.”  

Next came the nightgown. The silky fabric clung to her body, the front plunging down to her toned stomach, exposing just enough to make Ruby flush. Gem twirled in front of the mirror, the gown flowing around her legs.  

“Okay, this is, like, total goddess energy,” Gem said, adjusting the straps. “I could walk into a fancy party in this and have everyone, like, bowing at my feet.”  

“You’d also get kicked out for indecency,” Ruby said, her voice muffled by her hands.  

Gem grinned. “Worth it.”  

By the time she finished trying everything on, Gem had a pile of clothes she was taking home. “This was so much fun,” she said, tossing her hair as they walked to the register. “I’m, like, totally *the* moment.”  

Ruby sighed. “You’re a walking reality show.”  

“And you’re the lucky co-star,” Gem said, winking. “Let’s hit the food court after this. I need a pretzel. Or five.”  

---

The sisters wandered into the food court, the smells of fried food, sweet desserts, and savory delights mingling in the air. Gem, her golden hair cascading down her back, led the way with the confident stride of someone who owned the world—or at least this corner of the mall. She was still glowing from her clothing haul, swinging her shopping bags casually at her sides.  

“Okay, I’m, like, *starving*,” Gem announced, scanning the options. “Where do we even start? Pizza? Burgers? Ooh, maybe some nachos.”  

Ruby followed, clutching her much smaller bag and sighing. “Do you ever stop eating?”  

Gem grinned and flipped her hair. “Nope. It’s, like, one of my superpowers. Watch and learn, Rubes.”  

At the burger counter, Gem ordered a double bacon cheeseburger, large fries, a side of onion rings, and a milkshake. Ruby raised an eyebrow, but Gem wasn’t done. She moved on to the pizza stall, ordering two large slices loaded with toppings, then finished at a dessert kiosk where she grabbed a massive cinnamon roll.  

Ruby, meanwhile, settled for a modest grilled chicken sandwich and a bottle of water. As they found a table, she couldn’t help but gawk at the mountain of food Gem had assembled.  

“You’re seriously going to eat all that?” Ruby asked, setting down her tray.  

Gem plopped into her seat, flipping her hair over one shoulder. “Obviously. Like, where have you been?” She unwrapped her burger and took a massive bite, her smile widening as she chewed.  

Ruby poked at her sandwich, watching as Gem polished off the burger in record time. Then she moved on to the onion rings, popping them into her mouth one by one like they were popcorn.  

“Does your stomach, like, go to another dimension or something?” Ruby asked.  

Gem laughed, licking a bit of salt off her fingers. “Maybe. Or maybe I’m just *that* awesome. You know, Rubes, most people would kill for a metabolism like mine. And, like, have you *seen* me? I’m basically a goddess. I earned this.”  

Ruby rolled her eyes. “You don’t earn it. You just exist.”  

“Exactly,” Gem said with a wink, now tackling her pizza.  

By the time Ruby had managed to finish half her sandwich, Gem had devoured everything on her tray. She leaned back, completely unbothered, sipping the last of her milkshake.  

Ruby stared. “Where do you even put it all? You ate, like, three people’s worth of food.”  

Gem shrugged, her tone light and casual. “Good genes, babe. That, and I burn, like, a thousand calories just by existing. Oh, and did you *see* me in that black bikini earlier? My body *deserves* this level of fuel.”  

Ruby groaned, pushing her tray away. “You’re ridiculous.”  

Gem smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling in that impossibly perfect way. “Ridiculously fabulous, you mean.”  

As they stood to leave, Gem spotted a pretzel stand and gasped dramatically. “Oh my god, I forgot about pretzels! Wait here, Rubes. I need one for the road.”  

“Of course you do,” Ruby muttered, trailing behind as Gem breezed toward her next snack with the energy of someone who had all the time—and appetite—in the world.

### **Flexing at the Fitness Store**  

After leaving the food court (Gem with a giant pretzel in hand), the sisters wandered into a fitness store. The place was sleek and modern, with walls lined with gear and racks of activewear. Dumbbells, kettlebells, and barbells were neatly displayed along one side of the store, catching Gem’s eye immediately.  

“Oh my god, Rubes, look at all this,” Gem said, taking a bite of her pretzel as she strode over to the weights. “This is, like, *so* cute. Maybe I should get some stuff for the house.”  

Ruby followed hesitantly, still processing how Gem could eat so much and stay so ridiculously fit. “You don’t even work out, Gem. Why would you need weights?”  

Gem grinned, setting her pretzel down on a nearby bench. “I don’t need them. But it’s, like, fun to play around sometimes.”  

She walked up to the dumbbell rack and picked up a 100-pound weight in each hand as if they were featherlight. “See? Easy.”  

Ruby gawked. “Gem, those are a hundred pounds *each*! Put them down before you hurt yourself.”  

“Hurt myself? Please,” Gem said, rolling her eyes. “This is, like, *nothing*. I mean, have you *seen* me?” She flexed her biceps for effect, the definition in her arms startlingly visible. A couple of nearby shoppers stopped and stared, whispering to each other.  

Gem noticed and flashed them her perfect smile. “Oh, hi! Don’t mind me, just, like, messing around.”  

She started curling the dumbbells effortlessly, her golden hair bouncing with each movement. “One...two...three…” she counted, smirking at Ruby between reps. “You know, Rubes, this would probably help you with those stick arms of yours.”  

Ruby crossed her arms. “Not everyone’s a genetic freak like you, Gem.”  

“True,” Gem said, switching to overhead presses. “I *am* kind of a goddess. Like, if I wasn’t such a genius physicist, I could totally do fitness modeling. Or *any* modeling, really.”  

As she set the weights down with a light clank, a store employee approached, looking nervous. “Uh, ma’am, those weights are usually...not for casual use.”  

Gem turned to him, her smile dazzling. “Oh, sorry! I just couldn’t help myself. They’re, like, *so* fun.”  

The employee blinked, clearly unsure how to respond. “Well, uh...you seem very strong.”  

Gem winked. “Yeah, I get that a lot.”  

She grabbed her pretzel and turned back to Ruby. “Anyway, let’s check out the clothes. Maybe they’ve got something cute I can wear for, like, pretending to work out.”  

Ruby groaned. “You’re impossible.”  

“And fabulous,” Gem added, tossing her hair as she led the way to the activewear section.  

---

After Gem had thoroughly shown off at the fitness store, Ruby decided it was time for something more her speed. As they walked past a cozy-looking bookstore, she grabbed Gem’s arm.  

“Let’s go in here,” Ruby said. “I need a break from watching you show off.”  

Gem shrugged, taking the last bite of her pretzel. “Sure, Rubes. You can, like, browse the artsy stuff while I check out, I don’t know, books about me.” She smirked, tossing the pretzel wrapper into a trash can without looking—and somehow making the shot perfectly.  

The warm, inviting scent of paper and coffee greeted them as they entered the store. Ruby immediately made a beeline for the fiction section, while Gem wandered lazily, scanning the shelves with her usual air of confidence.  

A few minutes later, Ruby was flipping through a graphic novel when she heard an exaggerated gasp from the other side of the store.  

“Oh my god, Ruby! You have *got* to see this!” Gem’s voice rang out, drawing the attention of several nearby shoppers.  

Ruby sighed, reluctantly setting the book down. “What now, Gem?”  

She found Gem standing in the science section, holding up a sleek hardcover book. The title read: *The Mysteries of the Universe, Unlocked* by Dr. Gem Stone.  

Ruby blinked. “Wait...that’s *your* book?”  

Gem grinned, flipping her hair. “Duh. Bestseller, babe. Didn’t I mention it?”  

“No, you didn’t!” Ruby exclaimed, staring at the book. “When did you even write this?”  

Gem shrugged, opening the book to a random page and pretending to skim it. “Oh, you know, a couple of years ago. Between my PhD and, like, being awesome. It’s not a big deal.”  

“Not a big deal?” Ruby echoed, her voice rising. “You wrote a bestselling astrophysics book, and you *never told me*?”  

Gem laughed, patting Ruby on the head. “Aww, Rubes, you’re so cute when you’re flustered. But, like, honestly, it’s just science. I could probably write another one while eating nachos and watching Netflix.”  

Ruby groaned, snatching the book from Gem’s hands and flipping through it. The content was dense but presented in an engaging and accessible way. As much as Ruby hated to admit it, it was impressive.  

“This is ridiculous,” Ruby muttered.  

Gem leaned against the shelf, her golden hair catching the soft light. “Ridiculously amazing, you mean. And look, my author photo is *so* cute, right?” She pointed to the back cover, where a professionally styled headshot of Gem smiled back at them.  

Ruby squinted at the photo, then at Gem in real life. “It’s not fair. Even your picture is perfect.”  

Gem winked. “I know, right? Now, let’s buy this so you can, like, read up on how your sister is the smartest, most fabulous person ever.”  

Ruby sighed, clutching the book as they headed toward the register. “I’m never going to hear the end of this, am I?”  

“Nope,” Gem said, tossing her hair. “But, hey, at least you get to live in my orbit. That’s, like, a privilege, Rubes.”  

Ruby rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at her lips as Gem led the way—because as much as Gem drove her crazy, she wouldn’t trade her for anything.  

---

The car hummed softly as Gem maneuvered through traffic with effortless ease, one hand on the steering wheel and the other holding a soda she’d grabbed from the food court. Her blonde hair shimmered in the fading sunlight streaming through the windows, and her smile radiated pure satisfaction.  

“Oh my god, Ruby, today was, like, *so* much fun,” Gem said, glancing over at her sister, who was staring out the window with a tired but amused expression. “I mean, the mall is *always* a vibe, but today? Totally next level.”  

Ruby rolled her eyes but couldn’t help smiling. “You just liked showing off, as usual.”  

“Uh, duh,” Gem replied, flashing her perfect teeth in a grin. “Did you *see* me in that fitness store? Like, those dumbbells didn’t stand a chance. And then the bookstore? Iconic. People were, like, *dying* to get a glimpse of greatness.”  

“Yeah, you and your bestselling book that you conveniently forgot to tell me about,” Ruby muttered, crossing her arms.  

Gem laughed, a musical sound that filled the car. “Oh, Rubes, you’re too cute. I wasn’t hiding it; I just didn’t think you’d care. But, like, how awesome was that? Seeing my book in the wild? Totally surreal, right?”  

Ruby sighed. “I guess it was...impressive. Not that I’ll ever tell you that.”  

Gem winked. “It’s okay, babe. I already know. I mean, I wrote it, after all.” She took a sip of her soda and continued, “And the clothes! Oh my god, those bikinis were, like, *made* for me. I could’ve cleared out that store if I wanted to.”  

Ruby smirked. “If I had a dollar for every time someone in the store stopped to stare at you, I could’ve cleared out the store.”  

“Can you blame them?” Gem replied with a playful shrug. “It’s not every day you see a six-foot goddess casually strutting her stuff. Honestly, people should start paying me just to, like, exist in public.”  

Ruby burst out laughing, shaking her head. “You’re insufferable.”  

“Aw, but you love me,” Gem said, tossing her hair dramatically. “And admit it, you had fun today too. We make a great team—brains, beauty, and all-around fabulousness.”  

Ruby looked over at her sister, who was positively glowing with energy and confidence, and despite herself, she smiled. “Yeah, Gem. We do.”  

The car sped on as the city lights began to flicker to life, their laughter echoing into the evening.
