The sleek convertible hummed down the road, the top down and the wind whipping through their hair. Gem was at the wheel, one hand casually draped over the steering wheel, the other perched on the edge of the door as if she were posing for a magazine cover. Her golden hair shimmered in the sunlight, and her aviator sunglasses added an extra layer of cool to her already overwhelming presence.  

Ruby sat in the passenger seat, arms crossed, bracing herself for another Gem-centric monologue.  

“I still can’t believe how easy that paper was to publish,” Gem said, her voice a mix of nonchalance and pride. “I mean, astrophysics journals don’t just take anything, but when your work rewrites theories, they practically beg for it.” She smirked, glancing at Ruby out of the corner of her eye. “Not that I blame them. I’d beg for me too.”  

Ruby groaned. “Do you ever stop?”  

“Why would I?” Gem laughed, her perfect white teeth flashing. “Oh, and did I tell you about the time I fixed the particle accelerator in Geneva? They were stumped for weeks, and then I walk in, look at the problem, and bam—solved in an hour. They’re probably still talking about me over there.”  

Ruby rolled her eyes. “I’m sure they are.”  

“And you know,” Gem continued, as if Ruby hadn’t spoken, “I’m thinking of taking up surfing more seriously. Remember last summer when I caught that wave everyone else wiped out on? That was epic. It’s like my balance is just… flawless.”  

Ruby didn’t reply, but her silence only fueled Gem’s enthusiasm.  

“Speaking of balance, I can hold a one-arm handstand for over five minutes now,” Gem said, tapping her fingers on the wheel. “I timed myself yesterday. I mean, it’s not like it’s hard, but still, pretty impressive, right?”  

Ruby shot her a look. “If I say yes, will you stop?”  

Gem grinned, tilting her sunglasses down just enough to reveal her piercing blue eyes. “Not a chance. Oh! And wait until we get to the mall. I’ve been meaning to try on those ridiculously tight dresses at that new store. You can help me pick the one that makes me look the most like a goddess.”  

“You already act like one,” Ruby muttered under her breath, barely audible over the wind.  

Gem laughed again, the sound rich and melodious, as if Ruby’s remark was the highest compliment she could receive. “I know, right? Lucky you—you get to bask in my glory every day.”  

As they pulled into the mall parking lot, Gem parked the car with a fluid ease, flipping her sunglasses back into place. She leaned over to Ruby with a playful smirk. “Ready to have the best mall trip of your life?”  

Ruby sighed. “Let’s just get this over with.”  

Gem winked. “That’s the spirit.”

The glass doors of the mall slid open, and Gem stepped in first, radiating an effortless confidence that seemed to shift the atmosphere around her. Heads turned as she passed—men, women, even a few kids who barely knew why they were staring. Her golden hair shimmered under the fluorescent lights, and her lean, athletic frame seemed to glide rather than walk. She was wearing a fitted crop top that showed off her chiseled abs and a pair of high-waisted jeans that hugged her long, toned legs perfectly.  

Ruby followed a step behind, half-rolling her eyes and half-trying to pretend she wasn’t with her sister. “Does this happen everywhere you go?” she muttered.  

Gem grinned, flashing a smile that could have sold toothpaste. “Of course it does. What can I say? Some of us are just unforgettable.”  

They strolled past a group of teenagers loitering by the entrance. One of the boys nudged his friend and pointed at Gem, whispering something that made them both burst out laughing nervously. Gem noticed but didn’t miss a beat. She turned her head just enough to wink at them, sending the group into a flurry of awkward chuckles and blushing.  

Ruby groaned. “Do you *have* to encourage them?”  

“Rubes, I can’t help it if I’m a goddess among mortals,” Gem said, shrugging playfully. “Besides, they should feel lucky. Not everyone gets to witness perfection in person.”  

As they walked further into the mall, a woman carrying shopping bags stopped mid-stride and did a double take. “Excuse me,” she said hesitantly, “are you a model? Or an actress? You look so familiar.”  

Gem tilted her head and smiled, resting a hand casually on her hip. “Nope, just naturally stunning. But I get that all the time.”  

The woman laughed awkwardly and walked away, still glancing back over her shoulder.  

Ruby sighed. “This is going to be a long day.”  

“Oh, come on, it’s fun,” Gem said, tossing her hair back as they passed a display window featuring mannequins in glittering evening gowns. She stopped abruptly, her reflection catching her eye. “Ooh, remind me to try something like that on later. I bet I’d look amazing.”  

“You’d probably cause a scene,” Ruby muttered.  

Gem smirked, throwing an arm around her sister’s shoulders. “You say that like it’s a bad thing.”  

As they walked past the food court, Gem’s eyes lit up. “Oh, we’re definitely hitting that pretzel place later. And maybe the frozen yogurt shop. And—oh! I think there’s a new bakery here, too.”  

Ruby raised an eyebrow. “You’re planning to eat *all* of that?”  

“Of course,” Gem said with a laugh. “I burn calories just by existing. It’s a gift, really.”  

Ruby shook her head. “You’re impossible.”  

Gem grinned down at her sister. “And you wouldn’t have it any other way.”

The sisters entered a trendy boutique, the type with soft music, strategically dim lighting, and racks of expensive-looking clothes arranged like art exhibits. Gem immediately gravitated toward a rack of dresses, her fingers brushing lightly over the fabrics as she inspected each piece.  

“This one’s cute,” she said, pulling out a bodycon dress so tight it looked painted on. She held it up against herself, grinning. “What do you think, Rubes? Too much?”  

“Too much for where?” Ruby asked, already exasperated.  

Gem laughed, tossing the dress over her arm. “Exactly. Let’s see what else they’ve got.”  

She drifted over to a display of bikinis, her eyes lighting up as she grabbed a particularly skimpy one in a striking red. “Oh, this is happening,” she said, holding it up with a mischievous smirk. “I’ll model it for you.”  

Ruby groaned. “Do you *have* to?”  

Gem ignored her, gathering a few more items: a crop top that barely qualified as clothing, a pair of shorts so short they could pass for underwear, and another bikini, this one in black with gold accents.  

“I’m going to try these on,” Gem announced, heading toward the fitting rooms with her arms full. “Don’t go anywhere.”  

Ruby found a seat near the mirrors, bracing herself for what was coming.  

"Ta-da!" Gem announced, stepping out in the red bikini.  

Ruby looked up and immediately regretted it. The bikini fit Gem like it had been painted on, highlighting every curve of her impossibly toned body. Her abs were front and center, each muscle defined and gleaming under the dressing room lights. Her long legs seemed even longer, and her broad shoulders gave her an effortlessly powerful look.  

"You’ve got to be kidding me," Ruby said, covering her face with her hands.  

“What do you think?” Gem asked, spinning around slowly.  

“I think you’re going to cause someone to faint,” Ruby muttered, trying not to meet the stares of the other shoppers.  

“Good,” Gem said with a wink. “They’d be fainting for a good reason.”  

She moved on to the black bikini, this one even smaller. It hugged her curves in all the right places, the gold accents catching the light. As she adjusted the straps, a few other customers stopped pretending to shop and openly gawked.  

“Yep, definitely buying this one,” Gem declared. “It’s practically screaming my name.”  Gem turned sideways, checking out her reflection. "You think it makes my butt look good? I mean, obviously, it does. But, like, *extra* good?"  

Ruby groaned. "Gem, can you not? We’re in public."  

Gem ignored her, twisting to get a better view of her backside. "Damn, I look amazing. I should wear this to the beach and cause a scene."  

"You cause a scene just by existing," Ruby said.  

Gem grinned, striking a pose. "Thanks, Rubes. That’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me."  

Before Ruby could respond, one of the sales associates walked by, her eyes widening slightly when she saw Gem. "Wow, that bikini looks incredible on you," she said.  

Gem beamed. "Right? I was just saying how it really shows off my abs. And, like, my whole vibe, you know?"  

The associate nodded enthusiastically. "Absolutely. You look like you belong on a magazine cover."  

By the time she tried on the bodycon dress, Ruby was hiding her face in her hands. The dress clung to Gem’s figure like a second skin, highlighting every muscle and curve. She posed dramatically in front of the mirror, flipping her hair over her shoulder.  

After cycling through a few more outfits, including the tiny shorts and crop top combination, Gem finally returned to the fitting room to change back. When she emerged, she was carrying a pile of clothes.  

“Buying all of it,” she said, grinning.  

Ruby sighed as they headed to the register. “How do you manage to make everything an event?”  

“It’s a gift,” Gem replied, tossing her hair. “And you’re lucky to witness it.”

They go to a fitness store and Gem casually plays with the 100lb dumbbells.

They go to the food court and Gem orders a ridiculous amount of junk food, finishes it all without effort, and still looks flawless. Meanwhile, Ruby struggles with her own small meal, wondering where Gem puts it all.

---

They go to a bookstore and find a bestselling astrophysics book Gem wrote.
