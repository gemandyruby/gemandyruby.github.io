The rumble of the car’s engine hummed smoothly under Gem’s expert touch. She gripped the steering wheel with one hand, her other resting casually on the gear shift as she weaved effortlessly through traffic. The convertible top was down, letting in the crisp air and the faint scent of autumn leaves. Ruby sat stiffly in the passenger seat, clutching her phone like a lifeline, her eyes darting nervously between the road and her sister.  

“So there I was,” Gem began, her tone as breezy as the wind whipping through her sun-streaked hair. “The collider had malfunctioned—again, obviously, because nobody bothers to double-check the calibrations except me—and this giant tungsten plate was just *hovering*, barely supported by the crane. Everyone’s freaking out, right? I mean, it’s *tungsten*. That thing weighs, like, a ton.”  

Ruby adjusted her seatbelt and murmured, “Uh-huh,” though her voice was barely audible over the wind.  

Gem turned to her with an exaggerated grin. “So, I’m like, ‘Relax, I’ve got this.’ I sprint over, shove the crane out of the way, and hold the plate steady until the crew can reattach the cables. No big deal.” She flexed her free arm casually.  

“Of course not,” Ruby muttered, her voice tinged with sarcasm.  

Gem didn’t seem to notice. “The best part? Afterward, the team started calling me ‘Gem the Atlas.’ Isn’t that hilarious? I don’t even lift weights or anything—it’s all natural.”  

Ruby pressed her lips together, staring resolutely out the window. She didn’t trust herself to respond without saying something snide, and Gem’s stories always had a way of making her feel like the most ordinary person in the world.  

“So what’s the plan for today?” Gem continued, switching lanes with a fluid motion that would’ve impressed any driving instructor. “I mean, aside from you dragging me to the mall.”  

“You’re the one who said you’d come,” Ruby reminded her, finally daring to meet her sister’s eyes.  

“True,” Gem admitted, laughing. “I figured you needed some moral support or something. Shopping can be so intense, you know?”  

Ruby rolled her eyes. “Right. That’s exactly what I needed—your *moral support*.”  

Gem smirked, unfazed by her sister’s tone. “Oh, speaking of intensity, did I tell you about the time I ran a half-marathon backward? Blindfolded?”  

Ruby turned her head sharply. “What?”  

“Yeah, it was for charity. The whole thing was livestreamed. I had this whole system of echolocation worked out—super easy, actually, once you get the hang of it. I finished third, which was a bit disappointing, but hey, first time trying it blindfolded, so—”  

“Wait, wait, wait,” Ruby interrupted, holding up her hand. “Why would anyone even do that?”  

“Because it’s fun,” Gem said simply, flashing her a grin. “Also, it raised a ton of money for local schools. Win-win.”  

Ruby sighed and slumped deeper into her seat. She didn’t know what was more exhausting—Gem’s stories or the fact that they were probably all true.  

They pulled into the mall parking lot, Gem executing a perfect parallel park in one smooth motion. Ruby glanced at her sister, half-expecting her to burst into another story about winning a street racing championship on a whim, but Gem just turned off the engine and stretched lazily.  

“Well, here we are,” Gem announced, her voice lilting with anticipation. “Let’s go spend some money. Or, in my case, try on a bunch of stuff just to make it look good.”  

Ruby groaned as she unbuckled her seatbelt. “You’re impossible.”  

“And you love me for it,” Gem shot back with a wink, already striding toward the mall entrance like she owned the place.  

Ruby followed reluctantly, bracing herself for the inevitable spotlight her sister would command the moment they walked through the doors.

---

The automatic doors slid open, welcoming them into the brightly lit chaos of the mall. The chatter of shoppers, the faint smell of cinnamon pretzels, and the synthetic gleam of store windows created an atmosphere both lively and overwhelming. Ruby tucked her hands into the pockets of her hoodie, hoping to blend in. Unfortunately, blending in wasn’t an option when you were walking beside Gem.  

Gem strode confidently through the entrance, her every step commanding attention. She was wearing a cropped white tank top that clung to her like a second skin, leaving her chiseled abs completely exposed. The high neckline contrasted with the revealing cut, and the material shimmered faintly in the fluorescent light. Her tiny denim shorts, frayed at the edges, sat low on her hips, showcasing her long, toned legs. The smooth bronze of her skin seemed to glow as if she were perpetually lit by a summer sun.  

Her golden-blonde hair was pulled into a loose braid that cascaded over one shoulder, and a pair of oversized sunglasses perched atop her head. A delicate silver anklet sparkled with every step, catching the light like a secret treasure. Gem moved with the kind of unstudied grace that turned heads without effort, her sandals clicking softly against the tiled floor.  

It didn’t take long for people to notice. A group of teenagers stopped mid-conversation, their eyes wide as they whispered to each other. An older couple glanced over, the woman giving a disapproving shake of her head while the man’s gaze lingered just a moment too long. Even a security guard standing near the entrance seemed momentarily distracted, his radio crackling unanswered at his hip.  

Ruby felt the familiar prickle of secondhand embarrassment creeping up her neck. She ducked her head, trying to disappear into her hoodie, but it was no use. Gem’s presence was a spotlight that couldn’t be dimmed, and Ruby was caught in its glare.  

“Okay, where to first?” Gem asked, her voice carrying effortlessly over the noise of the mall. She turned to Ruby, her hands resting on her hips in a way that made her abs flex just enough to draw more attention.  

Ruby mumbled something incoherent, her eyes fixed on the floor.  

Gem laughed, the sound light and carefree. “Come on, Rubes, don’t be shy. This is supposed to be fun!” She looped an arm around Ruby’s shoulders and gave her a playful squeeze.  

A man passing by stumbled slightly, his gaze locked on Gem’s exposed midsection before he quickly averted his eyes. Gem didn’t seem to notice—or maybe she did and just didn’t care.  

“Maybe we should get pretzels first,” Gem suggested, steering Ruby toward the food court. “Or check out that new boutique upstairs. Oh! They have those massage chairs now, don’t they?”  

Ruby groaned softly, already regretting this trip. “Can we just get through this without causing a scene?”  

Gem raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a mischievous smile. “A scene? Me? Never.”  

As if on cue, a small child tugged on his mother’s sleeve, pointing at Gem with wide eyes. “Mommy, look! She’s like a superhero!”  

Gem winked at the boy as they passed, her grin widening. “See, Rubes? I’m just spreading a little joy.”  

Ruby sighed, pulling her hood up further. It was going to be a long day.

---

Ruby trailed behind Gem as they entered one of the mall’s trendiest clothing stores. The music thumped with a bass-heavy beat, racks were crammed with bright, summery pieces, and the air smelled faintly of new fabric and overpriced perfume. Ruby stuffed her hands in her hoodie pockets, hoping to keep a low profile.  

Gem, of course, had no such intentions.  

“Ooh, look at this!” Gem exclaimed, plucking a neon-pink bikini from a rack near the entrance. She held it up to herself, tilting her head as she studied its minimal coverage. The top was little more than two triangles of fabric held together by thin strings, and the bottoms—well, they barely existed.  

“Seriously, Gem?” Ruby muttered, glancing around to see if anyone was watching.  

Gem ignored her, already moving toward a rack of equally skimpy outfits. She pulled out a white crochet cover-up that was practically see-through, a slinky black minidress, and a bright yellow two-piece with high-cut bottoms. “These are perfect for my next beach trip,” she said, tossing them over her arm.  

A sales associate, a young woman with a trendy bob and a name tag that read *Maya,* approached with a professional smile that wavered as she took in Gem’s ensemble. “Let me know if you need a fitting room,” she said.  

“Absolutely,” Gem replied, flashing her a dazzling smile. She grabbed a few more items—a sequined halter top, a pair of metallic hot pants, and an impossibly tiny red bikini—before making her way to the fitting rooms.  

Ruby hesitated by a display of oversized sweaters, wishing she could just disappear into the folds of a particularly shapeless beige one. “I’ll wait out here,” she mumbled.  

Gem popped her head out of the fitting room a minute later, still fully dressed but holding up the neon-pink bikini. “Rubes, you *have* to see this one. It’s so me.”  

“Do I?” Ruby said, not moving from her spot.  

“Oh, come on,” Gem said, rolling her eyes. “You’re no fun.”  

When Gem finally emerged in the bikini, heads turned immediately. The bright pink fabric stood out vividly against her bronzed skin, and every line of her toned body was on full display. She struck a pose in front of the mirror, adjusting the straps with a practiced ease.  

“I think this one’s a keeper,” she said, inspecting herself from every angle.  

A teenage boy browsing nearby knocked over a stack of T-shirts, his face a deep shade of red as he tried to right the display. A woman with a stroller hurried past, muttering something under her breath. Even the sales associate seemed momentarily stunned, her professional demeanor faltering.  

Ruby buried her face in her hands. “Gem, can you maybe not do... whatever this is?”  

Gem laughed, spinning on her heel to face Ruby. “What? I’m just trying things on. Isn’t that the point of coming here?”  

Ruby peeked through her fingers. “You’re *causing a scene.*”  

Gem shrugged, clearly unbothered. “Let them look.”  

She disappeared back into the fitting room, only to emerge a few minutes later in the yellow two-piece. The high-cut design accentuated her legs, and the bandeau top highlighted her toned shoulders. She struck another pose, this time with her hands on her hips.  

“Gem!” Ruby hissed as a couple of shoppers stopped to gawk.  

“What? It’s called confidence, Rubes.” Gem winked, grabbing the crochet cover-up and slipping it over the bikini. The sheer fabric did little to hide anything, and the effect only seemed to draw more attention.  

By the time she’d tried on the sequined top, the hot pants, and the red bikini—which, predictably, left almost nothing to the imagination—a small crowd had gathered near the fitting room area. Gem basked in the attention, flipping her hair and chatting casually with the onlookers about fit and fabric.  

When Gem emerged from the fitting room in the red bikini, heads turned instantly. The vibrant red clung to her figure perfectly, accentuating her toned abs and long, sculpted legs. The high-cut bottoms and barely-there top left little to the imagination, showcasing her athletic physique like a work of art. 

She adjusted one of the straps casually, then turned toward the mirror with a critical eye, examining every angle. “Not bad,” she murmured, running a hand over the strings at her hips. “What do you think, Rubes? This one’s definitely got a little *wow* factor, right?”

Ruby barely had a chance to mumble an answer before the sales associate, Maya, approached with wide eyes and a beaming smile. “Oh my *god,*” Maya breathed, stopping short as if struck by the sight. “That is... absolutely incredible. You look like you just stepped out of a magazine.”

Gem laughed softly, brushing a strand of hair over her shoulder. “You think? I mean, it does fit pretty well.”

“*Pretty well?*” Maya repeated, her voice rising. “No, it’s insane. Your body is just... wow, like, your abs—can I say this?—they’re perfect. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

Gem smirked and gestured casually at her stomach. “Oh, these? Just a lot of planks and a little good luck.”  

Maya hesitated for only a second before blurting, “Do you mind? I mean—can I feel them? Just for a second?”

Ruby froze, her eyes darting between Gem and Maya in disbelief, but Gem just laughed again, clearly used to this kind of attention. “Sure, go ahead,” she said, striking a playful pose. “They’re not just for show.”

Maya’s hand hovered for a moment before she pressed her palm gently against Gem’s stomach. Her eyes went wide as her fingers traced over the defined ridges of Gem’s abs. “Oh my god, they’re like... rock hard,” she said, sounding almost reverent. “How do you even...?”

Gem grinned. “Told you, planks and good genes.” She flexed just slightly, and Maya pulled her hand back with an awed laugh.

“That’s unreal,” Maya said, shaking her head. “This bikini looks *amazing* on you, but honestly, with a body like yours, you could make anything look good.”

“Well, I’ll take that as a compliment,” Gem said, turning back to the mirror and giving her reflection one last approving nod. “I guess this one’s a keeper.”

“It’s more than a keeper,” Maya said enthusiastically. “It’s practically illegal how good you look in that.”

Ruby, meanwhile, was ready to sink into the floor. She tugged her hood tighter around her face and whispered, “Can we *please* leave now?”  

Gem finally relented, gathering her selections and heading to the register. As they walked out of the store, shopping bag in hand, she turned to Ruby with a grin. “See? That wasn’t so bad, was it?”  

Ruby groaned, trailing behind her sister as they headed for the food court. “It was *exactly* that bad.”  

---

The food court was a cacophony of smells, sounds, and energy as Gem and Ruby walked in. Families juggled trays, kids ran past tables, and the air was thick with the aroma of fried foods and sugary desserts. Gem, with her tiny crop top and impossibly short shorts, instantly drew attention as they strolled through. Heads turned, whispers followed, and Ruby walked just a step behind, trying not to notice.  

Gem stopped in front of a burger joint. “You know what sounds good? A double bacon cheeseburger. With chili fries. Oh, and a milkshake—chocolate, obviously.” She tapped her chin thoughtfully. “Maybe onion rings too.”  

Ruby winced. “You’re going to eat all that?”  

Gem shrugged, flashing her dazzling grin. “Of course. What’s the point of life if you don’t enjoy it?”  

Ruby, ever health-conscious, headed toward a salad place nearby. “I’ll just grab something light,” she mumbled, trying to ignore the twinge of envy that gnawed at her.  

They reconvened at a small table, Gem carrying a tray stacked high with greasy, calorie-laden delights. The burger alone looked like it could feed a family of four. Ruby set her modest salad and bottle of water down across from her, watching as Gem unwrapped her burger with almost childlike excitement.  

As Gem took a huge bite, a look of bliss crossed her face. “Oh my god, this is *so* good,” she said, her voice muffled through a mouthful of food. She swallowed and added, “You know, this reminds me of that time I won that hot dog eating contest.”  

Ruby blinked. “You entered a hot dog eating contest?”  

Gem nodded, dipping an onion ring into a pool of ranch dressing. “Yeah! It was a total fluke. We were at this beach festival, and they needed a last-minute participant. I wasn’t even planning on joining, but I thought, ‘Why not?’ And guess what? I ate *thirty-seven hot dogs* in ten minutes and won a giant trophy.”  

Ruby stared at her, utterly dumbfounded. “You’re joking.”  

“Nope!” Gem leaned back, sipping her milkshake with a smug grin. “And the best part? I went for a swim right after, and no stomach cramps. It’s like my body just knows how to handle stuff like that.”  

Ruby stabbed her salad with her fork, the crisp greens crunching under her grip. She glanced at Gem’s perfect abs, still visible beneath the crop top despite the feast she was devouring. It didn’t make sense. *How does she eat like this and look like that?*  

Gem didn’t seem to notice Ruby’s brooding, too busy demolishing her chili fries. “Oh, and speaking of swimming,” she continued, licking some cheese off her thumb, “did I ever tell you about the time I rescued that couple whose sailboat capsized?”  

“No,” Ruby said flatly, though she could already sense where this was going.  

Gem leaned forward, clearly enjoying the storytelling. “So, we were out on the water—this was during that kayaking trip last summer—and I saw them waving for help. The boat was flipped, and they were freaking out. So I dove in, swam all the way out there, flipped their boat back over, and helped them back in.” She popped another onion ring into her mouth. “The guy kept saying, ‘Are you even human?’”  

Ruby bit the inside of her cheek to keep from saying anything. Instead, she pushed her salad around her plate, the envy bubbling just beneath the surface. She looked at her sister—Gem, with her glowing skin, radiant smile, and the body of a Greek statue—and couldn’t help but feel the unfairness of it all. *She eats like this, does whatever she wants, and still looks like she walked out of a photoshoot.*  

Gem finished her burger with a satisfied sigh and leaned back in her chair. “You should’ve been there, Rubes. It was so much fun. Maybe next time I’ll teach you how to flip a boat. It’s all about leverage.”  

Ruby managed a weak smile, still trying to process how someone could be so effortlessly perfect—and so blissfully unaware of how maddening it was.

The gleaming lights of the fitness store reflected off rows of neatly stacked weights, racks of athletic wear, and walls adorned with posters of professional athletes. Gem and Ruby stepped inside, and it didn’t take long for Gem to gravitate toward the weight section.  

“Ah, I love this place,” Gem said, running a hand over a row of dumbbells. Ruby lingered near the yoga mats, trying not to attract attention.  

Gem stopped in front of the heaviest set of dumbbells—sleek black ones marked “100 LB.” With zero hesitation, she bent down, picked one up in each hand, and started pressing them above her head as if they weighed nothing.  

“Check this out,” Gem called over to Ruby, her arms pumping smoothly. “They’re so light I can’t tell if it’s a joke or if I’m just *that* strong.”  

Ruby rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath, “Definitely the second one.”  

A tall, muscular employee approached them, wearing a store-branded tank top that showcased his impressive biceps. He looked at Gem with a mix of admiration and disbelief. “Uh, can I help you with anything?” he asked, his gaze flicking nervously to the dumbbells in her hands.  

Gem flashed her trademark grin. “Nah, I’m just messing around. Oh, here—could you put this back for me?” Without thinking, she handed him one of the dumbbells.  

The worker’s face immediately tensed as he struggled to maintain his grip. “Wow, okay,” he grunted, adjusting his stance. The weight dragged his arm down before he managed to place it back on the rack with a loud clunk.  

Gem didn’t seem to notice his struggle, already distracted by the pull-up bar mounted to a display frame. “Ooh, this looks fun,” she said, walking over. She jumped up and grabbed the bar, effortlessly pulling herself into a series of rapid-fire pull-ups. Her legs stayed straight, toes pointed, and her movements were so fluid it looked like she was performing gymnastics rather than exercising.  

By now, a small group of shoppers and employees had stopped to watch.  

“Is this thing stable?” Gem asked mid-rep, glancing at the worker. “Feels like I could pull it right out of the wall.”  

The worker, still recovering from the dumbbell incident, nodded quickly. “It’s, uh, bolted pretty securely.”  

“Good to know.” Gem released the bar with a flip, landing gracefully on her feet.  

Ruby sighed, wishing she could melt into the floor. “Do you have to make a scene everywhere we go?”  

Gem grabbed a weighted medicine ball and tossed it up and down casually. “It’s not my fault people are impressed. Oh, hey, check this out!” She threw the ball high into the air, caught it with one hand, and spun it on her finger like a basketball before tossing it back onto the rack.  

The muscular worker, now standing near Ruby, leaned over and whispered, “Is she always like this?”  

“Unfortunately, yes,” Ruby replied, crossing her arms.  

Gem walked over to a display of kettlebells and hoisted the heaviest one—a 150-pound monster—above her head with ease. “Do you think this would look good in the home gym, Rubes?” she asked, striking a mock bodybuilder pose.  

Ruby sighed. “Sure, why not?”  

Gem laughed, setting the kettlebell down with a loud thud that made the floor tremble slightly. “Alright, I think I’m done here. Let’s check out the clothes.”  

The worker, still staring at her in awe, managed to stammer, “Uh, have a great day.”  

Gem winked at him. “You too!”  

---

The cool, quiet ambiance of the bookstore was a welcome contrast to the bustling mall. Ruby sighed in relief as they stepped inside, happy for a momentary reprieve from Gem’s overwhelming presence. Rows of neatly organized shelves stretched out before them, and the faint scent of paper and coffee lingered in the air.  

“Finally, a normal place,” Ruby muttered, trailing behind Gem as they wandered deeper into the store.  

Gem, however, seemed just as enthusiastic as ever. She scanned the shelves, her eyes lighting up when they reached the science section. “Ooh, let’s see if they’ve got anything interesting here,” she said, pulling Ruby along by the arm.  

Ruby barely had time to protest before Gem stopped abruptly, her gaze fixed on a stack of books prominently displayed on a table. The cover featured a dramatic rendering of a galaxy and a bold title: *Beyond the Stars: The Hidden Physics of the Universe.* Beneath it, in elegant letters, was the author’s name: Dr. Gemma Stone.  

Ruby blinked, her brow furrowing as she read the name again. “Wait... *you* wrote this?”  

Gem picked up a copy and grinned. “Yep! Wrote it years ago. Didn’t I ever mention that?”  

“No,” Ruby said, her voice tinged with disbelief. “You *definitely* didn’t.”  

Gem flipped through the pages casually. “Huh, must’ve slipped my mind. It was kind of a side project. You know, something to do between research breakthroughs and working out.”  

Ruby stared at her, her expression a mix of frustration and awe. “A *side project*? This is a bestseller!” She pointed to the gold sticker on the cover that proclaimed *Over 2 Million Copies Sold.*  

Gem shrugged, clearly unfazed. “Yeah, it did pretty well. The publisher was thrilled. Oh, and I handled all the translations myself.”  

Ruby’s jaw dropped. “All the translations? How many languages?”  

Gem tilted her head, pretending to count. “Let’s see... French, German, Mandarin, Spanish, Japanese, Russian... I think there are a few others, but those were the big ones.”  

Ruby gawked at her. “You’re fluent in all of those?”  

Gem laughed. “Well, yeah. Doesn’t everyone learn a few extra languages in their free time?”  

Ruby opened her mouth to retort, but no words came out. She glanced at the book again, flipping to a random page. The writing was clear and engaging, with complex concepts explained in a way that even a casual reader could understand.  

“You seriously never thought to tell me about this?” Ruby asked, her tone incredulous.  

Gem leaned against the table, casually flexing her toned arms as she rested the book on her hip. “I figured it wasn’t a big deal. I mean, it’s not like I wrote it for the fame or anything. I just wanted to make physics more accessible, you know?”  

Ruby shook her head, still trying to process the revelation. “Unbelievable.”  

A passing customer noticed Gem holding the book and stopped in her tracks. “Oh my gosh, are you the author?”  

Gem flashed a dazzling smile. “Guilty as charged.”  

The customer’s face lit up. “I *love* this book! It made me understand things I never thought I could. Can I get a picture with you?”  

“Of course!” Gem said, setting the book down and posing effortlessly.  

Ruby stood off to the side, watching the interaction with a mixture of irritation and reluctant pride. No matter where they went, it seemed Gem couldn’t help but steal the spotlight.  

As the customer walked away, giddy with excitement, Gem turned back to Ruby. “Anyway, I should probably grab a copy for you. You could use it to brush up on your science knowledge.”  

Ruby glared at her. “I think I’ve had enough of your surprises for one day.”  

Gem laughed, looping an arm around Ruby’s shoulders as they headed for the checkout. “Oh, come on, Rubes. Life’s more fun with a little mystery, don’t you think?”  

---

The sun was dipping below the horizon as Gem and Ruby headed home, the car bathed in the warm orange glow of twilight. Gem was behind the wheel, effortlessly maneuvering through traffic with the same casual confidence she seemed to bring to everything.  

"That was *so* much fun," Gem said, her voice bright and cheerful. "We should totally do stuff like this more often. Don’t you think, Rubes?"  

Ruby, sitting in the passenger seat with her arms crossed, glanced out the window and muttered, “Sure.”  

Gem didn’t seem to notice Ruby’s lack of enthusiasm—or if she did, she ignored it entirely. “I mean, did you see the way everyone in the mall couldn’t take their eyes off me? That was hilarious! And that guy at the fitness store? Poor dude probably needs to hit the weights more often, huh?”  

Ruby sighed, her gaze still fixed on the passing scenery. “Yeah, hilarious.”  

“And the bookstore!” Gem continued, her excitement undiminished. “I forgot how much people love *Beyond the Stars.* That lady was so sweet, wasn’t she? I should do book signings again. You’d come, right?”  

Ruby glanced at her sister, her expression a mix of irritation and resignation. “Do I have a choice?”  

Gem laughed, the sound light and musical. “Not really. But hey, you could totally use the chance to pick up some tips from the master.”  

Ruby rolled her eyes. “Right, because I *definitely* need advice from someone who’s good at everything without trying.”  

Gem reached over and gave Ruby a playful nudge on the shoulder. “Aw, don’t be like that, Rubes. You’re good at plenty of things. Like... uh…” She paused, thinking for a moment, before grinning. “You’re really good at glaring. Seriously, it’s like an art form.”  

Ruby couldn’t help the small smirk that tugged at her lips. “Gee, thanks.”  

“You’re welcome,” Gem said, clearly pleased with herself.  

They fell into a comfortable silence for a few moments, the hum of the car engine filling the space. Ruby glanced at her sister, taking in her relaxed posture and the easy smile on her face. As much as Gem’s constant brilliance grated on her, there was something infectious about her energy—something that made it hard to stay mad for long.  

“So,” Gem said, breaking the quiet, “what was your favorite part of the day?”  

Ruby hesitated, then shrugged. “I don’t know. The bookstore, I guess.”  

Gem raised an eyebrow. “The bookstore? Not the part where I found that gorgeous red bikini?”  

Ruby groaned. “Let’s just say the bookstore was the least exhausting part.”  

Gem laughed again, her eyes sparkling as she turned onto their street. “Fair enough. But come on, admit it—you had fun, didn’t you?”  

Ruby considered this for a moment before letting out a reluctant sigh. “Yeah, I guess it wasn’t *all* bad.”  

“I knew it!” Gem said triumphantly, pulling into their driveway. “See? I’m not just a genius, Rubes—I’m also a great big sister.”  

Ruby shook her head, a faint smile on her lips. “Whatever you say, Gem.”  

As they climbed out of the car and headed inside, Ruby found herself thinking that, despite the chaos and the constant spotlight on Gem, there was a part of her—small, but real—that couldn’t imagine the day without her sister.
