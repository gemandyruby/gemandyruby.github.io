The morning sun shimmered on the calm waters of the marina as Ruby and Gem approached the dock. Lisa was already there, standing next to her sleek, white sailboat, casually adjusting a line. She waved enthusiastically as they got closer.  

“Ruby! You made it!” Lisa called out, her grin wide and welcoming. Her gaze shifted to the woman walking beside Ruby, and her smile faltered slightly—more from surprise than anything else.  

Gem was impossible to miss. Her tight white tank top clung to her like a second skin, emphasizing her toned shoulders, the curve of her waist, and the swell of her chest. Her large, perfectly proportioned breasts strained subtly against the fabric, the snug fit making it impossible not to notice the flawless symmetry of her figure. The hem of her top stopped just above her belly button, revealing a strip of smooth, sun-kissed skin. Below that, she wore bikini bottoms so tiny they seemed like an afterthought, showing off the length of her athletic legs, toned and golden in the sunlight.  

Lisa blinked, momentarily caught off guard, before quickly recovering her composure as Ruby introduced them.  

“Lisa, this is my sister, Gem,” Ruby said, her tone a mix of pride and resignation. “Gem, this is Lisa. She owns the boat.”  

Gem stepped forward, her hand outstretched, her smile bright and confident. “Nice to meet you, Lisa. Thanks for inviting us out. I’ve been dying to get out on the water.”  

Lisa shook her hand, momentarily thrown by the firm, self-assured grip. “Uh, yeah, of course! I mean, it’s great to meet you too. Ruby’s told me a lot about you.”  

“Has she?” Gem asked, glancing at Ruby with a playful grin. “Hopefully, only the good stuff.”  

Ruby muttered something under her breath, while Lisa tried to refocus, keeping her gaze from wandering. “Well, it’s nice to finally meet you.”  

The three of them walked toward the boat, Lisa trying to keep the conversation light. “So, Gem, do you spend much time on the water?”  

“Not as much as I’d like,” Gem admitted, her eyes sparkling as she looked out at the harbor. “But I did spend a summer in the Caribbean once. Ended up free-diving with sharks. It was incredible.”  

Lisa paused mid-step. “Wait, sharks? Like, real sharks?”  

Gem shrugged, as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world. “Yeah. Hammerheads, mostly. They’re surprisingly chill if you don’t act like prey.”  

Ruby groaned, stepping onto the boat. “Here we go…”  

Lisa laughed nervously, her surprise clear. “That’s… wow. You’re, uh, braver than me.”  

Gem just smiled, following Ruby onto the boat, her movements smooth and self-assured. Lisa climbed aboard after them, still processing what Gem had just said.  

“So,” Lisa said, turning to Gem once they were all on deck. “What do you do for a living?”  

“Me?” Gem asked, reaching for the hem of her tank top. “Oh, I’m a physicist.”  

As she spoke, she peeled the tank top over her head, her motion fluid and effortless. The reveal left Lisa momentarily speechless. Gem’s tiny red bikini hugged her chest perfectly, lifting and supporting her large, rounded breasts in a way that seemed both precarious and entirely natural. The top emphasized the curve of her cleavage and the smooth line of her toned upper body, leaving very little to the imagination.  

Lisa froze mid-step, her mouth slightly open. “A… physicist?” she repeated, her eyes darting between Gem’s face and her impossibly fit body.  

“Yep,” Gem said casually, as though she didn’t notice Lisa’s reaction. She adjusted the straps of her bikini top, the simple motion drawing even more attention to her effortless poise. “I work on a lot of theoretical stuff. But enough about me—this boat is gorgeous, Lisa.”  

Lisa managed to recover, shaking her head slightly as though to clear her thoughts. “Uh, thanks! I mean, yeah. I’ve had it for a couple of years now…”  

As Lisa launched into a brief history of her boat, Ruby sank into a seat, already bracing herself for a day full of Gem effortlessly stealing the spotlight.

The boat rocked gently on the calm waves as Lisa cut the engine and let it drift. The sunlight glinted off the water, and a soft breeze carried the faint scent of salt. Lisa spread a towel over the deck and stretched out, adjusting her sunglasses. Ruby followed suit, settling on a lounge chair near the cabin, while Gem opted for a spot right in the center of the deck, basking in the full sun.  

Gem lay back with the ease of someone entirely comfortable in their skin, her toned body gleaming in the sunlight. Her red bikini left little to the imagination, and her long legs stretched out like she was posing for a photoshoot. Lisa glanced over, trying not to stare too obviously but clearly curious.  

“So, Gem,” Lisa began, propping herself up on one elbow. “I have to admit, when you said you’re a physicist, I was kind of blown away. No offense, but you’re not what I’d picture.”  

Gem grinned, tilting her sunglasses down to look at Lisa. “What were you picturing? A frazzled professor with a lab coat and a clipboard?”  

“Something like that,” Lisa admitted with a laugh. “Not, you know…” She gestured vaguely at Gem’s athletic, sun-kissed frame.  

“Fair enough,” Gem said, smirking. “I get that a lot.”  

Lisa hesitated for a moment, then asked, “How’d you even get into physics? Was it something you always wanted to do?”  

Gem shifted onto her side, resting her head in her hand. “Pretty much. I’ve always been curious about how the universe works. When I was a kid, I used to take apart clocks just to see if I could put them back together. Then I started building my own gadgets and messing with physics experiments in our garage. Drove Ruby nuts.”  

Ruby, sitting under the shade with a book in hand, looked up. “That’s because you kept blowing fuses. Dad made me share my allowance to cover the repairs.”  

Gem waved her off. “Details.”  

Lisa chuckled. “So, when did you start studying seriously?”  

“Depends on what you mean by seriously,” Gem said, leaning back again. “I started college when I was 12. By the time I was 16, I’d finished my PhD.”  

Lisa’s jaw dropped. “Wait. You had a doctorate at 16? How’s that even possible?”  

Gem shrugged, as if it were no big deal. “I skipped a few grades, tested out of a bunch of classes, worked my butt off. My thesis was on quantum field theory. It was a little controversial at the time, but it turned out to be pretty revolutionary.”  

Lisa stared at her, wide-eyed. “What do you mean by ‘revolutionary’?”  

Gem smiled, clearly enjoying the attention. “Let’s just say it changed the way people thought about certain aspects of particle physics. I won a couple of awards, got a ton of offers to work at different labs and universities… it was a wild time.”  

“Wow,” Lisa said, shaking her head in disbelief. “You’re like a real-life genius. And here I was thinking Ruby was the smart one.”  

Ruby snorted, muttering, “Don’t remind me.”  

Gem laughed, lying back down and closing her eyes against the sun. “It’s not as glamorous as it sounds. A lot of late nights, a lot of coffee, and a lot of people doubting you every step of the way.”  

Lisa tilted her head, studying her. “Still, that’s incredible. I mean, you’re obviously brilliant, and on top of that…” She gestured vaguely at Gem again, clearly referring to her athletic figure.  

Gem’s grin widened. “Thanks. I guess I’m lucky like that.”  

Ruby groaned quietly, flipping a page in her book. “Here we go…”  

Lisa ignored her, still looking at Gem. “So what do you do now? Research? Teaching?”  

“Bit of both,” Gem said, turning onto her stomach and resting her chin on her folded arms. “I’ve got a few projects in the works, mostly stuff I can’t talk about. But I also consult for some big companies and give the occasional lecture. It’s fun.”  

Lisa leaned back on her towel, shaking her head. “You’re seriously amazing, Gem. Like, I don’t know how Ruby keeps up with you.”  

Ruby muttered, “I don’t.”  

Gem just laughed, stretching luxuriously in the sunlight. “You’re sweet, Lisa. But really, I’m just doing what I love. Isn’t that what life’s about?”  

Lisa nodded slowly, her admiration evident. “Yeah, I guess it is.”  

Ruby, meanwhile, sank lower in her chair, already bracing herself for a day of Lisa gushing over her sister.

The sun continued its lazy arc across the sky as the three women lounged on the deck of the sailboat. Gem had shifted onto her stomach, her toned back gleaming in the sunlight, while Lisa sat cross-legged, dangling her feet over the side. Ruby reclined in her chair, sunglasses hiding her eyes but her expression one of mild annoyance—Gem’s stories from earlier still lingering in her mind.  

Lisa suddenly leaned forward, squinting at the water. “Hey, wait a second,” she said, pointing. “Is that... a shipwreck down there?”  

Both Ruby and Gem sat up, following Lisa’s gaze. The water beneath them was remarkably clear, revealing the shadowy silhouette of a large ship resting on the ocean floor. Its wooden hull, though weathered and partially collapsed, was still intact enough to make out its structure.  

“Whoa,” Ruby murmured.  

“That’s incredible,” Lisa added, her excitement growing. “It must be from centuries ago. Can you believe how clear the water is? You can see every detail!”  

Gem stood, shading her eyes with one hand as she peered down. Her face lit up with a grin. “That’s amazing. How deep do you think it is?”  

“Pretty deep,” Lisa replied. “You’d need diving gear to even think about getting down there.”  

Gem smirked. “Who needs gear?”  

Before either Ruby or Lisa could respond, Gem pulled her hair into a quick ponytail, adjusted her bikini straps, and walked to the edge of the boat.  

“Wait,” Ruby said, sitting up straighter. “What are you doing?”  

“Exploring,” Gem replied with a wink.  

Without another word, she dove smoothly into the water, cutting through the surface with hardly a splash. Lisa and Ruby exchanged a glance before rushing to the edge of the boat to watch.  

Gem swam downward with powerful, graceful strokes, her movements fluid and effortless. The sunlight streaming through the water illuminated her as she descended, her lithe form like an aquatic acrobat. She approached the shipwreck, and to Lisa and Ruby, it almost looked as if she were flying—darting in and out of broken windows, flipping and twisting with an ease that defied logic.  

For what felt like an impossibly long time, Gem remained underwater. She explored every corner of the wreck, pushing aside debris and investigating hidden compartments. Ruby checked her watch nervously, but Lisa was too enthralled to notice.  

Finally, after what seemed like forever, Gem reappeared at the surface, her ponytail plastered to her back and her grin as wide as ever. In one hand, she clutched a barnacle-encrusted chest that looked like it had no business being carried by one person.  

“Got something!” she called, paddling to the boat with the chest in tow.  

Lisa reached out to help, but Gem hoisted the chest onto the deck with one fluid motion, setting it down with a resounding thud. Lisa gawked at the sight.  

“How—how heavy is that thing?” Lisa stammered.  

“Pretty heavy,” Gem replied, catching her breath briefly. “But nothing I couldn’t handle.”  

Ruby raised an eyebrow. “You were down there forever. How are you not gasping for air right now?”  

Gem shrugged, her grin still intact. “Guess I’ve got good lungs.”  

The three of them gathered around the chest as Gem examined the old, rusted lock. Without hesitation, she grabbed the chest’s lid and, with a quick flex of her arms, snapped the lock clean off. Lisa and Ruby exchanged stunned looks as Gem flipped the lid open.  

Inside, glinting in the sunlight, was a collection of gold coins, jewel-encrusted goblets, and other valuables that looked like they belonged in a museum.  

Lisa’s jaw dropped. “This... this is actual treasure.”  

“Looks like it,” Gem said casually, picking up a gold coin and inspecting it.  

Ruby sighed, rubbing her temples. “Of course. Only you would find something like this on a random boat trip.”  

Lisa shook her head in disbelief. “Gem, you’re unreal. Do you even realize how crazy this is?”  

Gem laughed, leaning back on her hands. “What can I say? Sometimes life just works out.”

---

The sun was high, casting sparkling reflections on the waves as the boat gently rocked. Lisa was at the helm, steering them toward a secluded patch of ocean where the water was impossibly blue. Ruby sat nearby, flipping through a book, while Gem lounged at the bow, leaning back with her legs stretched out, her tiny bikini catching the sun as effortlessly as her radiant smile.  

Lisa glanced at Gem, still trying to wrap her head around the whirlwind that was Ruby's sister. "So, Gem," Lisa began, "is there anything you *can’t* do?"  

Gem laughed lightly, waving off the compliment. "Oh, tons of things. I just prefer sticking to what I’m good at."  

Before Lisa could respond, a sudden splash caught everyone’s attention. A pod of dolphins had surfaced nearby, their sleek forms slicing through the water.  

“Oh my God, look at them!” Lisa exclaimed, gripping the railing. “They’re beautiful.”  

Gem sat up, her eyes sparkling. “I’ve gotta get closer.”  

Before anyone could protest, she was already on her feet. With a quick stretch, she dove off the boat in a graceful arc, slicing through the water like an arrow.  

Ruby sighed and shut her book. “Of course.”  

Lisa leaned over the edge, watching in awe as Gem swam toward the dolphins with effortless speed. The pod seemed to notice her immediately, circling her with curiosity. To Lisa’s astonishment, the dolphins didn’t dart away. Instead, they seemed to welcome Gem, their sleek bodies playfully weaving around her.  

“What is she *doing*?” Lisa whispered, half in disbelief.  

“Being Gem,” Ruby replied flatly, though her lips twitched into a small smile.  

Gem swam alongside the dolphins, her movements so fluid it was as though she belonged to the ocean. At one point, she gently reached out, and one of the dolphins seemed to respond, nudging her hand with its nose.  

Then, with a laugh they could hear from the boat, Gem grabbed hold of the dolphin’s dorsal fin. The creature didn’t shy away but instead seemed to delight in the interaction, speeding up and pulling her along.  

Lisa’s jaw dropped. “She’s... riding a dolphin. Like, actually riding it.”  

Ruby groaned and rested her forehead against the railing. “I can’t take her anywhere.”  

After a few more loops around the boat, Gem let go, laughing as she treaded water and waved back at her sister and Lisa. The dolphins circled her one last time before diving deeper into the ocean, disappearing as quickly as they’d come.  

Gem swam back to the boat and climbed aboard with ease, water cascading off her skin. She grabbed a towel and wrung out her hair, grinning from ear to ear.  

“That,” she said, “was incredible.”  

Lisa stared at her, still in shock. “You just... rode a dolphin. How... how does that even happen?”  

Gem shrugged nonchalantly, wrapping the towel around her shoulders. “I don’t know. They just seemed friendly. Guess I got lucky.”  

Ruby muttered under her breath, “Like always.”  

Lisa shook her head, watching Gem with a mix of admiration and disbelief. “You’re something else, Gem.”  

Gem laughed and flopped onto a lounge chair. “I guess dolphins have good taste.”

As the sun dipped lower in the sky, painting the horizon with warm hues, the breeze began to pick up. Lisa adjusted the sails, her face relaxing into a peaceful smile. “This is perfect,” she said, glancing at Gem, who was lounging with her hands behind her head.  

Ruby, seated beside her sister, squinted at the darkening clouds on the horizon. “Uh… are we sure about that? Those clouds don’t look great.”  

Lisa followed Ruby’s gaze, her smile faltering. The breeze became a sharp gust, and the waves grew choppier. “It’s probably nothing, but let’s head back to shore, just in case.”  

They began to navigate the boat back toward the marina, but within minutes, the weather turned. The wind howled, and rain pelted down in sheets. The boat rocked violently, each wave growing larger than the last.  

“Hold on!” Lisa shouted, gripping the wheel with white-knuckled determination.  

Ruby clung to the side of the boat, her face pale. “This is bad—really bad!”  

Gem, on the other hand, was calm. She stood with perfect balance, seemingly unaffected by the lurching vessel. “The mast’s holding, but there’s something dragging us,” she said, her voice steady even over the roar of the storm.  

“What do you mean dragging us?” Lisa asked, her voice tinged with panic.  

Gem pointed to the back of the boat, where the rudder struggled to respond. “I think something’s caught underneath. If we don’t fix it, we’ll capsize.”  

Lisa gaped at her. “Fix it? How are we supposed to—”  

But Gem was already pulling off her tank top, revealing her tiny bikini. She didn’t hesitate, diving headfirst into the surging waves.  

“Gem!” Ruby shouted, fear tightening her throat.  

Lisa could only watch, stunned, as Gem disappeared beneath the surface. The water churned violently, and visibility was almost nonexistent, but Gem’s movements were impossibly precise. Even in the chaos of the storm, she swam with grace and speed, making her way to the bottom of the boat.  

Ruby and Lisa clung to the rail, squinting through the downpour as they tried to catch a glimpse of her. “I can’t believe she just went in,” Lisa muttered, equal parts awe and disbelief.  

Underwater, Gem reached the rudder and found a thick clump of tangled seaweed and debris caught around it. With a swift pull, she tore the obstruction away, her strength unaffected by the raging currents. She inspected the hull briefly, ensuring there were no further issues, before pushing herself upward with powerful strokes.  

She broke the surface with a gasp, rain streaming down her face. “We’re good!” she shouted, her voice cutting through the storm.  

Gem climbed aboard effortlessly, her wet skin glistening in the dim light. She shook out her drenched hair, unbothered by the wild weather. “Lisa, steer us to the left! Ruby, tighten that rope over there!”  

Ruby scrambled to follow her sister’s instructions, her hands fumbling with the slippery rope. Lisa adjusted the wheel as best she could, her earlier panic giving way to determination.  

Gem joined them, steadying the sails and bracing against the wind. Together, they fought the storm, and though the waves threatened to topple them, the boat held steady.  

Finally, after what felt like hours, the storm began to subside. The wind eased, the rain tapered off, and the sea grew calm once more. The three of them collapsed onto the deck, exhausted but relieved.  

Lisa turned to Gem, her chest rising and falling as she caught her breath. “You… you just dove into that storm like it was nothing. Who *are* you?”  

Gem grinned, brushing wet strands of hair from her face. “Just someone who loves a good challenge.”  

Ruby groaned, half-annoyed and half-admiring. “You’re impossible.”  

Lisa let out a breathless laugh, shaking her head. “Well, I don’t know what we would’ve done without you.”  

The sun broke through the remaining clouds, casting a golden glow over the water. Gem leaned back, stretching lazily as if nothing had happened. “Guess that makes this another perfect day,” she said with a wink.  

Ruby sighed, but a small smile tugged at her lips. “Only you, Gem. Only you.”
